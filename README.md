This is only my quick start template for typescript apps with react native.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

git clone https://github.com/marcos-navarro/react-native-typescript-template.git
```

### Have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed




### Installing

Go to root folder and run fallows steps:

```
npm install
```

```
mkdir compiled
```
```
npm run tsc:w

## Deployment
